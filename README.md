## Java for Android Workshop

*Protip:* Bring an Android device and USB cable with you to connect to your computer! We cannot guarantee spares. Without a device you will be unable to test your app without the use of a virtual machine.

#### Learning Objectives

After this workshop, students will be able to:
- Identify their Android version.
- Use their computer connect to an Android device.
- Use Android Studio to design an app's user interface.
- Write code in Java to make the user interface interactive.
- Describe the Java build process.
- Test their application on an Android device.

#### Goals of this Workshop

While learning about Android, you will ultimately learn:
* The basic syntax of the Java language
* What the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) are.
* How to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as **Android Studio**.
* Common Java libraries and frameworks, and how they can be leveraged to quickly build robust applications.
* The basics of the Android platform and how Java fits into the picture
* How to take this knowledge to build a simple Android app.
