## Getting Started

Before we get started, we need to make sure we have a few tools on our computer! This guide will assist you in configuring your computer and Android device to use **Android Studio**.

#### Installation Instruction

Please take the time to follow these steps to get Android Studio up and running on your computer. Some of these steps can take some time (a few students have averaged up to an hour depending on their internet connection) and we want you to be able to get the **most** out of our Java for Android workshop.

1. Download the latest version of Android Studio: http://tools.android.com/download/studio/builds/1-5-1 - be warned that you may be required to install the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) first! Android Studio will warn you if so. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete this step if required.
2. Once you have downloaded **Android Studio**, you should then proceed to install it.
3. After you have completed installation you will be prompted to import settings. Select *I do not have a previous version of Studio*...
4. You'll now be walked through the *welcome* wizard. Select **next**.
5. The next screen prompts you to locate the **Java Development Kit (JDK)**. If you do not have the JDK, you'll need to download and install it to continue. You can find the **JDK Version 7.x here**: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html - If you *need to install the JDK*, take note of where it is installed. Below are a few of the default locations. The **Detect** button works rather well, but it isn't a bad idea to play it safe and take note.
  - Mac OS X Location: `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_65.jdk/Contents/Home`
  - Windows Location: `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_65`
6. Select the **Standard** installation type. Then select **Next**.
7. Review the changes that are about to be made to your computer. Once you're sure everything looks good, select **Finish**.
8. Ironically, we selected finish but now **Android Studio** needs to download support files. This can take some time.
9. You may also be asked permission to install the **Intel HAXM** software. If so, allow the installation and continue.
10. Once everything is completed, you should see the following message:
  ```
  Android SDK is up to date.
  Running IntelÂ® HAXM installer
  ```
11. Select **Finish**. You'll be greeted with a *Welcome to Android Studio* window!
12. That's all you have to do to get prepared for our workshop. If you run into any problems, please note the step you are currently on as well as what happened. Reach out to us and we'll do our best to assist!
