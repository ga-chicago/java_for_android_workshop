---

##QUIZ
1. What is the most commonly used mobile OS in the world?
2. What is the most fragmented mobile OS in the world?
3. What job market is one of the hottest in the world?

---

## Why Android?

* Android has 76% of the global mobile OS market share (per [Statista](http://www.statista.com/statistics/271774/share-of-android-platforms-on-mobile-devices-with-android-os/))
* Android is an ever changing, growing environment. It is also great for developers to get into!
* Android jobs are on the rise; companies that used to solely focus on iOS apps realize that the market is changing. To reach more users, they must target the Android platform.

## Learning Objectives

After this workshop, you will be able to:
- Identify their Android version.
- Use their computer connect to an Android device.
- Use Android Studio to design an app's user interface.
- Write code in Java to make the user interface interactive.
- Describe the Java build process.
- Test their application on an Android device.

---

## Goals

While learning about Android, you will ultimately learn:
* The basic syntax of the Java language
* What the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) are.
* How to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as **Android Studio**.
* Common Java libraries and frameworks, and how they can be leveraged to quickly build robust applications.
* The basics of the Android platform and how Java fits into the picture
* How to take this knowledge to build a simple Android app.

## Designing an Android app

* We're going to use Android Studio to design an application.
* Our goal is to create a basic calculator application.

---

## Making an app come to life

We're going to need to understand some Java to make our app come to life. Let's take a look into some basic Java data types.

---

## Java Data Types

* **int** - 32bit (4byte) integer value. Used for integer numbers. 0, -2, 42.
* **short** - 16-bit (2byte) integer value
* **long** - 64bit (8byte) integer value
* **byte** - 8bit (1byte) integer value
* **float** - 32bit (4byte) floating point value. Used for numbers that need decimals but do not need to be very accurate (no physics here!).
* **double** - 64bit (8 byte) floating point value. Used for currency. Supports decimals. 0.42, 0.1, 3.14
* **char** - 16bit character (unicode)
* **boolean** - true or false
* **String** - Just lines of text.

## Testing it on your device

* We're going to take some time to walk through setting up your phone to test your App!
